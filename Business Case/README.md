The Eco-Friendly Water Bottle Launch project proposes designing and releasing a 100% biodegradable, reusable water bottle within eight months to meet rising demand for sustainable products. The project addresses the environmental harm caused by single-use plastics while creating a new revenue stream projected at $1.2M in the first year. With clear financial and brand-building benefits, manageable risks, and strong market potential, the business case recommends moving forward with the launch.
